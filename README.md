⚡️ Energy Consumption Efficiency Analysis ⚡️
This project compares the energy efficiency of homes when they are Occupied 🏡 vs Unoccupied 🏚️ using A/B testing with an independent t-test to see if there's a significant difference in energy consumption between the two.

📋 Project Overview
This project performs an analysis on energy consumption data to determine whether homes are more energy-efficient when occupied or unoccupied. By using statistical methods like t-tests, we compare the two scenarios and provide visualizations to showcase the differences.

✨ Features:
Data Preprocessing: Filter the dataset into occupied and unoccupied homes.
A/B Testing: Apply t-test analysis to identify differences in energy consumption.
Visualization: Generate charts 📊 for better insights into energy usage.
🗂️ Data Description
The dataset includes:

home_id: Unique identifier for each home.
energy_consumption_kWh: Energy usage (in kWh).
occupancy_status: Status of the home ("Occupied" 🏡 or "Unoccupied" 🏚️).
Other: Additional attributes like season, temperature, and appliance usage.
📊 Visualization & Results
The analysis generates visual comparisons between occupied and unoccupied homes. A t-test is performed, and the conclusion is based on whether the p-value is below the 0.05 significance level.
